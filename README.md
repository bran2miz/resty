# Overview

To this point, state has been owned and managed soley in class based React components, using 'this.state' with 'this.setState()' and instance methods to manage it all. 

Newer versions of React allow for "function components" to also manage their own state, using a newly exposed API, called "Hooks"

# Class Outline

rafce - react arrow function export component (auto creates a function based component)

- give the name of the state (variable name) and set a starting value. 
- no need to use "this"

# Lab 27 useEffect to tap into the lifestyle

- works in replacement of componentDidMount
- use an effect hook to manage state at various (tactical) times during the life of a component
